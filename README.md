Basically we decided we needed a vacation project ok? Stuff like this happens all the time. 

## Building/running and stuff

0. make sure `qemu` and `build-essential` are installed on an `x86_64` os. 
1. run `make all`
2. * for any old linux distribution run `make run`
    * for *WSL* run `run-wsl`
3. debugging can be done by replacing `run` with `debug` in the previous commands.
